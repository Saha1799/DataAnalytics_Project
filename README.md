This project provides a comprehensive visualization-driven insight into the global impact of the COVID pandemic.

Project 3:Diwali_SalesAnalysis_Project

Tool and Library Selection: Leveraged Python for data analysis and visualization, incorporating essential libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Data Preprocessing: using pandas and dropped null values, ensuring the dataset was clean and primed for effective analysis.
Gender-Based Analysis: Conducted an exploratory data analysis highlighting females as predominant buyers, reinforced with a bar chart showing females having higher purchasing power than males.
Demographic Insights: Identified the age group 26-35 years, predominantly females, as the leading buyer segment. Regional insights spotlighted Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka as the states with the highest orders and sales.
Occupational and Marital Status Overview: Discovered that a majority of buyers are married women working predominantly in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors.
Product Category Breakdown: Visual analysis showed that the top-selling product categories during Diwali were Food, Clothing, and Electronics.

Conclusion:
Married women in the 26-35 age bracket, hailing from UP, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, and employed in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation, show a strong preference for purchasing items from the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories during Diwali.

Project 3:Ecommerce Sales Dashboard

Tool & Data Preprocessing: Employed Power BI, initiating the project by cleaning and transforming raw data using Power Query, ensuring a structured dataset for analysis.
ETL Operations: Executed Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations to efficiently manage and manipulate the dataset for accurate visual representation.
DAX Implementation: Utilized DAX queries, specifically "TotalYTD", to fetch year-to-date insights and metrics.
Visual Analysis: Presented comprehensive visuals including KPIs for YTD sales, quantity, profit, and profit margin.
Advanced Visualizations: Incorporated a donut chart for YTD sales analysis by region and shipping mode, a geographical map for YTD sales by state, and a stacked column chart to display various other insights.

Through this dashboard, comprehensive sales metrics are vividly captured, offering valuable ecommerce insights at a glance.

Project 5:Sales Analysis Python Project

Tool and Library Selection: Leveraged Python for data analysis and visualization, incorporating essential libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Data Cleaning: Identified and removed null values, ensuring a sanitized dataset for precise interpretation.
Data Grouping & Visualization: Using the groupby function, generated pie and bar charts to display the sum of sales for different months.
Data Manipulation: Utilized the split function to segregate data effectively. Subsequently visualized total sales for each city within a specific state.
Deep Product Analysis: Assessed metrics such as 'Total count Quantity ordered', 'Total Amount of each product', and 'Most_sold_products'. Incorporated pivot tables for enhanced data structure and removed any duplicate entries.
Product Grouping: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of grouped products to discern patterns and preferences among consumers.

This project offers detailed insights into sales trends, regional sales dominance, and product preferences, guiding actionable business strategies.

Project 6:Sales Analysis Dashboard

Tool Selection: Deployed Power BI, a robust data visualization and analysis tool, to design an interactive Sales Analysis Dashboard.
