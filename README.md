Introduction:

Welcome to our Data Analytics repository, a holistic hub that hosts a series of projects crafted using both Power BI and Python. This space is dedicated to providing comprehensive insights, interactive visualizations, and intricate data analyses across various datasets. 

Project 1:CoronaAnalysis_Dashboard

1)Data Cleaning: The first step in this project i involved cleaning the dataset by addressing null or missing values. This ensured that our data was accurate and reliable for analysis.

2)Tool Selection: I have Utilized Power BI, a powerful data visualization tool, to transform the raw data into insightful charts and visuals.
3)Visualization Techniques: Incorporated a variety of charts such as Donut, Stack, and Maps to represent different facets of the data.
4)Case Analysis: Analyzed and presented key metrics including total cases, active cases, and serious or critical cases.
5)Map Visualization: We used geographical mapping to display COVID-19 statistics on a global or regional scale. This map visualization provided users with a clear understanding of how the virus was spreading across different regions.
6)Comprehensive Analysis: The dashboard provided a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 situation, allowing users to drill down into specific regions or time periods to gain deeper insights into the data.

By following these steps and using tools like Power BI, donut charts, stacked charts, and maps, created an informative and visually appealing Corona Analysis Dashboard Portfolio project informed about the pandemic's progression and its impact on different regions.


Project 2:Covid_Analysis_Python_Project

1)Platform & Language: Conducted the analysis using Python within the Jupyter Notebook environment, ensuring interactivity and easy code visualization.used Numpy,pandas libraries.
2)Data Cleaning: to provide accurate analyse used pandas Identified and deleted null or missing values, ensuring a clean dataset for accurate data interpretation.
3)Diverse Visualizations: Utilized line charts, bar charts, and pie charts to effectively represent various COVID metrics and insights.
Detailed Analysis: Presented a Tree map representation of COVID cases by country, tracked case evolution over time, and assessed the Total COVID test ratio, among other key data points.
4)In-depth Country Analysis: Highlighted the Top 20 countries in terms of Total Cases, Total Deaths, and Total Recoveries.
5)Regional Insights: Investigated the 'Total Deaths' with respect to WHO regions and visualized the 'Total Deaths' to 'Confirmed Cases' ratio.

This project provides a comprehensive visualization-driven insight into the global impact of the COVID pandemic using python.

Project 3:Diwali_SalesAnalysis_Project

1)Tool and Library Selection: Leveraged Python for data analysis and visualization, incorporating essential libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
2)Data Preprocessing: using pandas and dropped null values, ensuring the dataset was clean and primed for effective analysis.
3)Gender-Based Analysis: Conducted an exploratory data analysis highlighting females as predominant buyers, reinforced with a bar chart showing females having higher purchasing power than males.
4)Demographic Insights: Identified the age group 26-35 years, predominantly females, as the leading buyer segment. Regional insights spotlighted Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka as the states with the highest orders and sales.
5)Occupational and Marital Status Overview: Discovered that a majority of buyers are married women working predominantly in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors.
6)Product Category Breakdown: Visual analysis showed that the top-selling product categories during Diwali were Food, Clothing, and Electronics.

Conclusion:
Married women in the 26-35 age bracket, hailing from UP, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, and employed in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation, show a strong preference for purchasing items from the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories during Diwali.

Project 3:Ecommerce Sales Dashboard

1)Tool & Data Preprocessing: Employed Power BI, initiating the project by cleaning and transforming raw data using Power Query, ensuring a structured dataset for analysis.
2)ETL Operations: Executed Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations to efficiently manage and manipulate the dataset for accurate visual representation.
3)DAX Implementation: Utilized DAX queries, specifically "TotalYTD", to fetch year-to-date insights and metrics.
4)Visual Analysis: Presented comprehensive visuals including KPIs for YTD sales, quantity, profit, and profit margin.
5)Advanced Visualizations: Incorporated a donut chart for YTD sales analysis by region and shipping mode, a geographical map for YTD sales by state, and a stacked column chart to display various other insights.

Through this dashboard, comprehensive sales metrics are vividly captured, offering valuable ecommerce insights at a glance.

Project 5:Sales Analysis Python Project

1)Tool and Library Selection: Leveraged Python for data analysis and visualization, incorporating essential libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
2)Data Cleaning: Identified and removed null values, ensuring a sanitized dataset for precise interpretation.
3)Data Grouping & Visualization: Using the groupby function, generated pie and bar charts to display the sum of sales for different months.
4)Data Manipulation: Utilized the split function to segregate data effectively. Subsequently visualized total sales for each city within a specific state.
5)Deep Product Analysis: Assessed metrics such as 'Total count Quantity ordered', 'Total Amount of each product', and 'Most_sold_products'. Incorporated pivot tables for enhanced data structure and removed any duplicate entries.
6)Product Grouping: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of grouped products to discern patterns and preferences among consumers.

This project offers detailed insights into sales trends, regional sales dominance, and product preferences, guiding actionable business strategies.

Project 6:Sales Analysis Dashboard

1)Tool Selection: Deployed Power BI, a robust data visualization and analysis tool, to design an interactive Sales Analysis Dashboard.
2)Data Cleaning: Prioritized the removal of discrepancies and inconsistencies in the dataset to ensure accurate representation of sales data.
3)Card Visualizations: Incorporated cards to instantly showcase key metrics including sum of quantity, amount, profit, and Average Order Value (AOV).
4)Chart Utilizations: Adopted the area chart to visualize the sum of AOV over time, while stack and bar charts were used to dissect the sum of amount by states and by individual customer names.
5)Diverse Data Exploration: Leveraged the donut chart to provide insights into the sum of quantity based on payment modes and product categories. Additionally, month-wise profit analysis was conducted.
6)In-depth Insights: The dashboard effectively brings forth patterns, consumer behaviors, and performance metrics, driving data-backed decision-making.
